# Get started with GitHub
## What is git?
To understand the GitHub, you must first have an understanding of Git.Git is an open-source version control system that was started by Linus Torvalds—the same person who created Linux.
So git is version control system, but what does it mean that?When developers create something (an app, for example), they make constant changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first official release. Version control systems keeps tracks of these changes. Hence we can easily revert changes to previous state whenever we want.
Git is not only useful for developers but others also can use it if they found git useful for them. For example, if you have a team, that is constantly making changes to a document file then you can use the git as a VCS.

**The GitHub :**
    As we know git is the version control system, there are also so many options are available. So, what makes GitHub special? Git is a command-line tool, but the center around which all things involving Git revolve is the hub ir.e GitHub.com,  where developers store their projects.
    To know furher more about the GitHub, we should know some important terms related to the GitHub. I will give a short introduction about that terms.
    
* Repository:
This is the location where we keep or host our project. Sometimes GitHub users called it as repo.

* Forking a Repo:
 When you want start a new project based on the existing project we use this feature.If you find a project on GitHub that you’d like to contribute to, you can fork the repo, make the changes you’d like, and release the revised project as a new repo. If the original repository that you forked to create your new project gets updated, you can easily add those updates to your current fork.
 
 * Social Networking:
 When we release an project over the GitHub, the users of our project can report the bugs to us on GitHub. Hence we can communicate with them and resolve their doubts and the bugs reported by the users will help us to improve our project.
 GitHub profile can used as resume of a deveoper on which we can show source code written by the deveoper or by the pull requests.
 
 * Changelogs:
  When multiple people collaborate on a project, it’s hard to keep track revisions—who changed what, when, and where those files are stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository.
  
 * Branch:
  We can work on multiple versions of file or set of files(project) on the same time.git is version control system, hence automatically keeps the snapshots of each commits(in case of git changes are called as commit). Hence we need not keep multiple folders of different versions. All of this is handled by the git. We can also revert the changes made in file or set of files. Where is each branch is indepenent to each other if changes are made into a one branch it does not affect to other branch until we merge them. This is the most important feature of git by which we can work in collabroation.
  
   This was the short intro about the what is the git and what is the GitHub.
