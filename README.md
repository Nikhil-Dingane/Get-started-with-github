# Get started with GitHub
## What is git?
To understand the GitHub, you must first have an understanding of Git.Git is an open-source version control system that was started by Linus Torvaldsâ€”the same person who created Linux.
So git is version control system, but what does it mean that?When developers create something (an app, for example), they make constant changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first official release. Version control systems keeps tracks of these changes. Hence we can easily revert changes to previous state whenever we want.
